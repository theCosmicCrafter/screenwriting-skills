# screenwriting-skills

[中文版](README_ZH.md)

13 Claude Code skills for screenwriting and dramaturgy, distilled from 19 books (Chinese, American and Japanese) plus two complete master-work corpora: Chekhov's plays and Ozu Yasujiro's screenplays.

Skill bodies are written in Chinese (the sources and quotations are Chinese translations); frontmatter descriptions are in English with Chinese keywords so both languages trigger them.

## Conventions

- `SKILL.md` frontmatter: `name` (kebab-case, matches folder) and a long English `description` ending in "Use when …", with Chinese keywords in parentheses for triggering.
- Skill bodies are Chinese; numbered principles, tables and checklists; cross-references between skills by folder name.
- `reference.md` holds worked examples and quotations so `SKILL.md` stays under ~60 KB.
- License: for personal study use. Quotations remain the property of their authors and translators.
